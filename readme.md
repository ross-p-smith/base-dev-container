# Base Dev Container

This repo is a template for creating a VSCode DevContainer. It is not here to solve any IaC or application code. It assumes that you will build Azure Resources using Terraform and deploy your application code using a makefile.

- Terraform
- az cli
- Make file
- .env

It will be opinionated and lightweight.

## How to use
Clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
make all
```
